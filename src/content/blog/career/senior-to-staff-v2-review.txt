CURMUDGEONLY STAFF ENGINEER REVIEW
===================================
Article: "From Senior to Staff: What You Need to Change and What Your Org Needs to Provide"
Reviewer disposition: 14 years in, promoted to staff at two different companies, seen this movie before.

---

OVERALL TAKE
------------
Better than 90% of the "how to get to staff" slop on the internet. The two-sided
framing (you AND the org) is the right call and I wish more people said it. But there
are spots where the article tells a clean story that real life doesn't support, and a
few claims that would get picked apart in any serious engineering Slack.

---

SPECIFIC ISSUES
---------------

1. THE 70/30 RATIO IS MADE UP (Line 51)
   "If it's more than 70/30 toward doing it yourself, you're still working like a
   senior engineer."

   Says who? Where does 70/30 come from? This reads like a number someone picked
   because it felt right. A staff engineer at an infrastructure company might be 90/10
   toward "I did it" because their job IS building the platform others use. A staff
   engineer embedded in a product org might be 20/80. The ratio depends entirely on
   the archetype (Tanya Reilly's four archetypes would be useful here). Presenting a
   single ratio as a universal benchmark is the kind of oversimplification this article
   claims to avoid.

   SUGGESTION: Either cite where 70/30 comes from, or frame it as "if the ratio is
   heavily skewed toward solo work, that's worth examining" without inventing a
   threshold.


2. STAFF ENGINEER ≠ ONE THING (Throughout)
   The article treats "staff engineer" as a single role with a single profile: the
   cross-team connector who shapes problems and enables others. That's ONE archetype.

   Will Larson (Staff Engineer book) and Tanya Reilly identify at least four:
   - Tech Lead: deep in one team, sets technical direction
   - Architect: cross-team technical vision
   - Solver: parachutes into the gnarliest problems (this person IS still solving)
   - Right Hand: extends a VP's reach

   The "Solver" archetype directly contradicts Shift #1. Some staff engineers are
   promoted precisely BECAUSE they solve problems nobody else can. Telling them to
   "stop solving" is wrong for their archetype.

   SUGGESTION: Acknowledge that staff roles vary. The shifts described fit the
   Architect/Tech Lead archetype best. A one-paragraph caveat would do it.


3. THE BAND DIRECTOR ANALOGY DOESN'T LAND (Line 92)
   "a band director who only hired musicians who could outplay him — making himself
   the weakest player in the room. That's the vibe."

   No it isn't. A staff engineer should NOT be the weakest technical person in the room.
   That's a manager. Staff engineers maintain deep technical credibility — that's
   literally what distinguishes the role from engineering management. The analogy
   confuses "you don't have to be the one playing the solo" with "you should be worse
   at your instrument than everyone else." A staff engineer who can't go deep when
   needed loses the trust that makes the rest of the role work.

   SUGGESTION: Reframe. The point is about ego (you don't need to be the star soloist)
   not about skill (you should still be able to sit in and play).


4. THE "WHAT NOT HOW" DICHOTOMY IS TOO CLEAN (Lines 79-92)
   The senior-you/staff-you dialogue examples are good, but they imply staff engineers
   never get into the how. In practice, staff engineers regularly go deep on the how
   for critical decisions — they just do it selectively. A staff engineer who only ever
   says "here's the problem, you figure it out" loses credibility fast, because the
   team starts to wonder if they actually CAN go deep anymore.

   The real shift isn't from how to what. It's from "how is my default" to "what is my
   default, and I drop into how when the stakes are high enough."

   SUGGESTION: Add a line about when staff engineers DO get into the how: high-risk
   architecture decisions, novel problem domains, when the team is genuinely stuck.


5. "30% OF ENERGY ON PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THEIR GROUP" (Line 55)
   This is attributed to Ferrazzi's research but it's a study of leadership teams and
   executives, not IC engineers. Applying executive-team research to IC staff engineers
   without acknowledging the context difference is sloppy. A staff engineer spending
   30% of their time on other teams' problems might be exactly what's needed — or it
   might mean they're spread too thin to have deep impact anywhere. It depends on the
   org size, the role archetype, and whether anyone asked for their help.

   SUGGESTION: Flag that this finding is from executive team research and note that
   the right percentage varies. The principle (look beyond your team) is sound; the
   number is not transferable.


6. THE STAFF TRACK DIAGNOSTIC TABLE IS BINARY (Lines 116-124)
   Real orgs are messier than "real track" vs. "paper track." Most companies are
   somewhere in between — they have some staff engineers but the criteria are unclear,
   or there's cross-team work but no protected time for it. The table forces a binary
   that doesn't match reality.

   Also, "more than three in the right column" as the cutoff — why three? Same problem
   as the 70/30 ratio. Arbitrary thresholds presented as diagnostic criteria.

   SUGGESTION: Frame it as a spectrum, not a binary. "The more rows that land in the
   right column, the more skeptical you should be about whether the track is real."


7. MISSING: THE POLITICS OF STAFF PROMOTION (Throughout)
   The article barely touches on the reality that staff promotions are deeply political
   at most companies. They require a sponsor with enough org capital to push it through
   a calibration meeting. They require a "packet" that tells a story. They require
   timing — if the company just did layoffs or is in a headcount freeze, nobody's
   getting promoted regardless of merit.

   The article covers sponsorship (point 4 in Part 2) but treats it as a management
   behavior, not as a political reality the engineer needs to navigate. Staff
   candidates need to understand calibration, know who's in the room when decisions
   are made, and actively manage their promotion narrative. That's not gaming the
   system — it's understanding it.

   SUGGESTION: Add a subsection or callout about the mechanics of how staff promotions
   actually get decided at most large companies. Calibration meetings, promo packets,
   the role of skip-levels, timing windows.


8. "PARTICIPATION TROPHY" IS DISMISSIVE (Line 134)
   "The staff title becomes a participation trophy."

   This is a good line for Twitter engagement but it's reductive. Some companies give
   staff engineers decision input rather than decision authority, and that's a
   legitimate organizational choice — not necessarily a dysfunction. In highly
   regulated industries (finance, healthcare), architectural decisions MUST go through
   formal review. A staff engineer who has strong input into that review process isn't
   holding a participation trophy; they're operating within a compliance framework.

   SUGGESTION: Soften slightly. The point about decision authority is valid, but
   acknowledge that "own the decision" vs. "have strong input into the decision"
   depends on industry and context.


9. MISSING: THE COMP QUESTION (Throughout)
   The article never mentions compensation. In practice, the senior-to-staff gap is
   often $50-100K+ in total comp at larger companies. This creates real incentive
   distortions: engineers who don't actually want to do staff-level work pursuing the
   title for the pay bump, and companies that use the comp gap as a retention tool
   rather than a reflection of different work.

   A curmudgeonly staff engineer would ask: "Are you sure you want to do this work, or
   do you want the comp band?" Both are valid answers, but the article assumes everyone
   pursuing staff actually wants to do staff work.

   SUGGESTION: At least mention that the comp incentive exists and that wanting the
   money is fine — but you should be honest with yourself about whether you'd enjoy
   the actual day-to-day of the role.


10. THE "ASK THREE PEERS" EXERCISE NEEDS A WARNING (Line 173)
    "Ask three peers... 'If I were up for a staff promotion, what would be the
    strongest argument against it?'"

    This is great in theory and dangerous in practice. In many orgs, openly signaling
    that you're targeting staff can backfire — it can come across as entitled, or it
    can leak to your manager before you're ready to have that conversation. And "the
    strongest argument against" is an incredibly vulnerable question to ask someone you
    don't trust deeply.

    SUGGESTION: Add a caveat about choosing these three people carefully. They need to
    be people who will keep the conversation private and give honest feedback without
    using it against you. In some org cultures, this exercise is actively risky.


11. MISSING: THE TIME-IN-ROLE REALITY (Throughout)
    Most large companies have minimum time-in-level requirements (typically 18-24
    months at senior before staff is even discussable). The article doesn't mention
    this at all. An engineer reading this who's been senior for 8 months might think
    "I'll start working on these shifts now and get promoted next cycle" when in
    reality the system won't even consider them yet.

    SUGGESTION: Mention that most orgs have time-in-level expectations and that
    starting the behavioral shifts early is smart — but don't expect the promotion
    to follow immediately.


12. THE "GO SOMEWHERE ELSE" OPTION IS UNDERDEVELOPED (Line 201)
    "Go somewhere that has what you need" gets one paragraph. But this is actually the
    most consequential decision in the article. How do you evaluate whether a new
    company has a real staff track BEFORE you join? Interview questions to ask?
    Signals to look for? How to avoid jumping from one paper track to another?

    SUGGESTION: Add 3-4 interview questions you can ask to evaluate a staff track
    from the outside. E.g., "How many people were promoted to staff last year?"
    "Can I talk to a current staff engineer about their day-to-day?" "What
    percentage of your staff engineers' time is on cross-team work?"

THINGS THAT ARE GOOD (credit where due)
----------------------------------------
- The two-sided framing is genuinely rare and valuable
- The diagnostic table, despite being too binary, is more concrete than 90% of
  career advice articles
- Part 3 (When It's a You Thing) being separate and honest is strong
- "Where This Advice Falls Short" section — most articles don't do this at all
- The senior-you/staff-you dialogue comparisons are clear and useful
- "you want senior engineers who also do extra stuff for free" — nailed it
- The tone is genuinely better than most. Doesn't feel like a LinkedIn thought leader
  trying to sell me a course

---

BOTTOM LINE
-----------
Would I share this with a senior engineer on my team? Yes, with caveats. I'd say
"read this for the framing, but know that staff roles are more varied than this
makes them sound, and the promotion process is more political than this admits."
The article is 80% there. The remaining 20% is the messy, org-specific, political
stuff that's genuinely hard to write about in a general article — but acknowledging
it exists would go a long way.
