CURMUDGEONLY STAFF ENGINEER REVIEW: V3 vs V2
=============================================
Article: "From Senior to Staff" — condensed version (v3)
Reviewing against: v2 (the 21-min version we already tightened)
Reviewer disposition: same grumpy person, now comparing what got cut.

---

OVERALL TAKE
------------
The compression is impressive — you kept the skeleton and most of the muscle.
But you also lost some connective tissue that was doing more work than it
looked. A few cuts saved words but cost clarity, and two spots now read like
a summary of a better article instead of the article itself. Let me be
specific.

---

MATERIAL LOSSES FROM V2
------------------------

1. THE INTRO LOST ITS EMPATHY (v2 lines 18-22, v3 lines 16-18)

   v2 had: "I've seen really talented engineers burn two, three years trying
   to 'level up' at companies that didn't actually have a staff track. They
   had a title on a career ladder doc somewhere, sure. But nobody had ever
   been promoted into it."

   v3 cut this entirely. That paragraph is why someone trusts you enough to
   keep reading. It says "I've been close to this, I've watched it happen,
   I'm not going to waste your time." Without it, the intro is competent
   but cold — it reads like a thesis statement instead of a conversation.

   SUGGESTION: Add back ONE sentence. Something like "I've watched talented
   engineers burn years chasing a title that didn't actually exist at their
   company" slotted in after "you're stuck" on line 18. Costs you ~15 words.
   Buys you credibility for the next 2,000.


2. "LET'S START WITH YOU, BECAUSE IT'S THE PART YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO
   SOMETHING ABOUT" (v2 line 43, cut from v3)

   This line did two things: it acknowledged that the org stuff is outside
   your control, and it set the tone — "we're going to be practical, not
   theoretical." v3 just jumps in with the thesis. It's fine, but it lost
   a beat that made the reader feel guided.

   SUGGESTION: Not critical. But if you're looking for 8 words to add back,
   these are good ones.


3. THE PEER EXERCISE LOST ITS TEETH (v3 line 101 vs v2 lines 188-192)

   v2 had: "Don't defend yourself. Just listen. If two out of three say the
   same thing, that's your development area. One conversation like this will
   teach you more than six months of reading articles about staff
   engineering (including this one)."

   v3 only kept: "If two out of three say the same thing, that's your
   development area."

   The "don't defend yourself" instruction is the whole point. Without it,
   engineers will ask the question, hear something uncomfortable, explain
   why the person is wrong, and learn nothing. That's the default behavior
   for anyone technical enough to be reading this article. The instruction
   to shut up and listen is what makes the exercise actually work.

   SUGGESTION: Add "Don't defend yourself. Just listen." back before the
   "two out of three" line. Six words. Non-negotiable.


4. "IDENTITY RENOVATION" IS GONE (v2 line 186)

   v2 had: "That's not a career tactic. It's more like an identity
   renovation, and it takes way longer than a quarter."

   v3 has: "That's an identity renovation, and it takes longer than a
   quarter."

   Wait — actually v3 does have this. My mistake. But v3 lost the "That's
   not a career tactic" lead-in, which set up the contrast nicely. The
   phrase "identity renovation" landing after "career tactic" makes it
   clear this isn't resume optimization — it's something deeper. Without
   the setup, "identity renovation" is still good, but it hits with less
   force.

   SUGGESTION: Minor. Add "It's not a career tactic —" before "it's an
   identity renovation." Five words.


5. THE "WHAT TO DO THIS WEEK" SECTION LOST THE PEER EXERCISE (v2 line 286)

   v2's closing action list had four items including "Run the peer test from
   Part 3." v3's closing has three items and dropped this. But the peer
   exercise is the single most actionable, most uncomfortable, most
   valuable thing in the entire article. If someone reads to the end and
   only does ONE thing, it should be that.

   SUGGESTION: Add it back as a fourth bullet. "**And do this**: Ask three
   trusted peers the question from the diagnostic above. That conversation
   is worth more than anything else in this article." ~20 words.


6. THE V2 ORG SIGNALS LIST WAS BETTER (v2 lines 200-208 vs v3 line 103)

   v2 had seven specific signals including two killers:
   - "You write a staff-level proposal and your director presents it at the
     next leadership meeting as their own idea"
   - "There's no real gap between 'senior IC' and 'director' — nothing in
     between where ICs make real decisions"

   v3 kept only four and dropped both of those. The "director steals your
   proposal" signal is the one that makes readers go "holy shit, that
   happened to me" — it's recognition, not advice, and recognition builds
   trust faster than anything. The "no gap between senior and director"
   signal is structurally important because it diagnoses a whole category
   of orgs that don't believe in senior IC roles at all.

   SUGGESTION: Add at least one back. The stolen proposal one is the
   strongest — it's vivid, specific, and instantly recognizable. Costs
   ~20 words.


7. "WHERE THIS ADVICE FALLS SHORT" — GONE ENTIRELY

   v2 had five caveats: company size (<100 engineers), crisis mode,
   can't fake it, watch what leadership funds, cross-team work is slower.

   v3 folded exactly ONE of these in (regulated industries, under the
   diagnostic table) and dropped the rest.

   The ones that actually matter:
   - "If things are on fire, forget all of this" — this is critical context.
     An engineer at a company doing layoffs right now who reads this and
     starts trying to do cross-team strategy work is going to look tone-deaf.
   - "Watch what leadership funds, not what they say" — this is maybe the
     most practical single line in the entire article. It's a diagnostic
     tool that cuts through corporate BS in five seconds.

   SUGGESTION: Add both back as a two-line paragraph after the diagnostic
   table or at the end. Something like: "Two caveats: if your company is
   in crisis mode, shelve this — trying to do cross-team strategy during
   layoffs makes you look out of touch, not strategic. And always watch
   what leadership funds, not what they say. If the budget, the meeting
   invites, and the decision authority all flow to managers, the IC track
   isn't real no matter what the career ladder doc says." ~55 words, but
   they prevent the article from being naive.

CLARITY ISSUES (NOT ABOUT WHAT WAS CUT)
-----------------------------------------

8. THE COMPRESSED ORG REQUIREMENTS PARAGRAPH IS A WALL (v3 lines 89-91)

   v2 had five numbered, individually explained requirements. v3 compressed
   them into a single paragraph with bold phrases. The problem: it's now a
   wall of text that a scanning reader will skip entirely. And this is the
   part aimed at LEADERS — the people who need to hear it most and have the
   least patience for dense paragraphs.

   The "air cover" point gets a follow-up sentence, but the other four are
   just parentheticals inside bold phrases. "Active sponsorship (creating
   opportunities, not waiting)" — a leader reads that and says "yeah I do
   that" and moves on. v2 had the Ferrazzi example about a leader whose
   team's growth was capped by his bandwidth, which made sponsorship
   concrete and harder to dismiss.

   SUGGESTION: You don't need to go back to five full paragraphs. But at
   minimum, break this into a bulleted list instead of a run-on paragraph.
   Scanning readers need visual hooks. The Ferrazzi example for sponsorship
   is worth adding back as one sentence.


9. THE "IS IT YOU OR THE ORG?" MERGE IS FINE BUT NEEDS A BEAT (v3 line 95)

   Combining Parts 3 and 4 into one section was a good structural call.
   But the transition from "it might be you" to "it's probably the org"
   has no breathing room. v2 had a horizontal rule and a new heading between
   them. v3 has two blank lines.

   This matters because the emotional register is completely different.
   "It might be you" is uncomfortable. "It's probably the org" is
   validating. Smashing them together without a pause makes the you-part
   feel like a speed bump on the way to the org-part, which undermines the
   "look in the mirror" message.

   SUGGESTION: Add a single transitional sentence before the org signals.
   Something like "Now the flip side." (v2 had this — "Now the flip side.
   If you've honestly sat with Part 3 and it doesn't ring true, look at
   these signals." You can use just the first three words.)


10. "UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANICS MATTERS" IS WEAKER (v3 line 111)

    v2 had: "understanding the mechanics matters as much as doing the work."

    v3 has: "understanding the mechanics matters."

    The "as much as doing the work" is the part that makes engineers sit up.
    Most engineers believe the work speaks for itself. Telling them that
    understanding the political mechanics matters *as much* is the
    uncomfortable truth that makes this section worth reading. Without it,
    "understanding the mechanics matters" is a nothing sentence.

    SUGGESTION: Add "as much as doing the work" back. Five words. They
    carry the whole section's thesis.

THINGS V3 DID WELL (credit where due)
---------------------------------------
- Archetype section compression is clean — one paragraph instead of a
  bullet list, loses nothing material
- The four shifts are tight without feeling gutted
- Diagnostic table survived intact — smart, it's the most shareable part
- Promo mechanics section kept all the right beats (packet, calibration,
  manager capital, visibility, timing, time-in-level)
- The gold callout quote survived
- The comp honesty check in the intro is still there and still good
- The "go deep" caveat survived the cut
- Interview questions for evaluating new orgs survived — practical and
  differentiating
- Reading time dropped from 21 to 9 — that's a real improvement for
  the target audience

---

BOTTOM LINE
-----------
v3 is a good compression. It's not a hatchet job. But it made about six
cuts that saved 100 words total while costing real reader trust and
actionability. The fixes above add ~130 words (bringing you to roughly
10 min, still under budget at 238 wpm) and restore the material that
separates this from every other "how to get to staff" article on the
internet.

Priority order if you're going to be stingy about word count:
1. "Don't defend yourself. Just listen." (6 words — makes the exercise work)
2. "as much as doing the work" (5 words — makes the promo section land)
3. The empathy sentence in the intro (~15 words — builds trust)
4. The stolen proposal org signal (~20 words — builds recognition)
5. The two caveats from "Where This Falls Short" (~55 words — prevents naivety)
6. Org requirements as bullet list (0 extra words, just reformatting)
7. Peer exercise in What to Do This Week (~20 words — closes the loop)
